# Fixed VAE Training Instructions

This document provides instructions for running the fixed VAE training process that addresses the KL loss issues.

## Problem Summary

The original VAE implementation had two main issues:

1. The KL loss was increasing to very high values (around 20) during training
2. There was an error in the validation monitor related to the `mean_squared_error` function

## Solutions Implemented

1. **Fixed KL Loss Calculation**:
   - Added clipping to z_log_var to prevent extreme values
   - Reformulated the KL loss calculation for better numerical stability
   - Added L2 regularization to the latent space parameters
   - Reduced the KL weight to 0.0001 and extended the annealing period

2. **Fixed Training Scripts**:
   - Created a simplified training script that avoids the validation monitor error
   - Fixed the original training script by updating the validation monitor

## Running the Fixed Training

You have two options to run the fixed training:

### Option 1: Use the Original Script (Fixed)

```bash
# Navigate to the project directory
cd vit+vae

# Run the original training script
python main.py train-vae --epochs 10
```

### Option 2: Use the Simplified Script

```bash
# Navigate to the project directory
cd vit+vae

# Run the simplified training script
python run_simple_train.py
```

The simplified script removes the validation monitor that was causing errors but still implements all the fixes for the KL loss issue.

## Expected Results

With these fixes, you should observe:

1. **Stable KL Loss**: The KL loss should remain at reasonable values (typically between 0 and 5)
2. **Better Balance**: The model should better balance reconstruction quality with latent space regularization
3. **Improved Latent Space**: The latent space should be more structured and useful for downstream tasks

## Monitoring Training

During training, pay attention to:

1. The KL loss value - it should stabilize at a reasonable value
2. The reconstruction loss - it should decrease steadily
3. The KL weight - it should increase gradually due to annealing
4. The total loss - it should decrease steadily

## Further Adjustments

If you still experience issues with the KL loss, you can try:

1. Further reducing the KL weight in `config/model_config.py`
2. Adjusting the clipping range for z_log_var in `models/vae.py`
3. Adding dropout to the encoder to prevent overfitting
